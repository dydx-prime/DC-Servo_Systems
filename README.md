# DC-Servo_Systems

Simulation of two systems using AC-Servo motors with the help of matlab and control theory concepts.

## Overview

- System 1: Simulating a AC-Servo motor attached to a disk, where the postition model of the motor is used to simulate a quick stop for 50[ms]

- System 2: Simulating a AC-Servo motor attached to a sliding beam (more like a screw that moves the beam), where a cart is attached on top of the beam. By using the postion servo model, the cart can slide back and forth for a variety of position intervals.

- In combination, the cart will have to go through the disk for the short stop of 50[ms], moving back and forth throught the simulation.
